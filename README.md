 The following graphs show the most impoactful features that are contributing to the growth of the sales for the company.

These models show the top 3 most impactful features.  They are the Outlet_Type_Supermarket_Type3, Outlet_Size_High, and Item_MPR.  These all contribute to increasing the sales of the groceries.  The Supermarket Type 3 increases sales by 2595.185.  The Size High increases sales by 1128.768.  The Item"_MRP increases the sales by 984.593.

The top 5 most important features.
1. Item_MPR
2. Outlet_Type_Grocery_Store
3. Outlet_Type_Supermarket_Type3
4. Outlet Establishment_Year
5. Item_Visibility

I choose to look at the Visibility and the Snack Foods columns.  I wanted to see how these two would affect the sales of the products in the stores.

In the Visbility Column, we see that the predicted sales value is 315.15.  According to the model, the Item_MRP, Outlet_Establishment_Year, and Item_Type_Other are the positive columns that will have the biggest affect on the Item_Visibility.

Sales is what drives visibility but having too much inventory hurts its sales.

We can also see that in the Individual Force Plot Graph The base value suggests that there will be $2,210 in sales. The predicted sale price is  315.15, which is much less than the base value of $2,210.  The Outlet_Type_Grocery_Store is pushing the prediction to the negative side.  The Outlet_Establishment_Year is the highest column pushing the prediction to the positive side.

In the Snack Foods column, the predicted sales value is 3587.40.  According to the model, the Outlet_Type Grocery, and Item_MRP are the positive columns that will have the biggest affect on the Item_Type_Snack Food.

The Individual Force Plot hows that the true value suggests that there will be a decrease in sales. The predicted sale price is 3587.40 Rupees, which is much less than the true value of 4390.2852 Rupees. The Outlet_Type_Grocery_Store is pushing the prediction to the positive side. The Item_MRP is the highest column pushing the prediction to the positive side. The Outlet_Type_Supermarket_Type3 is pushing the prediction to the negative side.
